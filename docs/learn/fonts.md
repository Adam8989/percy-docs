# Font services

Percy supports rendering pages that rely on third-party web typography services.

If you use a **free font service** like Google Fonts, everything should just work.

If you use a **subscription web font service** (like TypeKit, Fontdeck, Cloud.typography, etc.), you may have to add Percy to your list of allowed hosts. The hostname to add is: `proxyme.percy.io`
